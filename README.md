# Differential-Evolution
A [differential evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_evolution) library written in Object Pascal. By using differential evolution (DE) it's possible to optimize a problem iteratively by trying to improve candidate solutions with regard to a given measure of quality.

## Compatibility
This library has not been tested or used with recent versions of Delphi or Lazarus. However, given the fact that it's not rocket science the code should still work.
